      <h1> How the dog nose works </h1>
      <h3> fact #1</h3>
      <p id="class" class="D3"> Have you ever wondered why your dog's nose is wet? That's because of the mucus covering to help your dog smell. </p>
      <h3 class="margins"> fact #2 </h3>
      <p class="D3"> Even though in cartoons dogs are known for their ears, their sense of smell is their strongest. </p>
      <h3 class="margins"> fact #3 </h3>
      <p class="D3"> Dogs' noses are like a human's eyes. They help them see the world. Your dog knows that you are you because they recognise your scent. </p>
